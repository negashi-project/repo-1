	<h2>Negashi Etiopiska Islamiska Föreningen</h2>
	
	<p>Negashi is a non-political and non-profit association established by Ethiopian Muslims living in Stockholm, Sweden.
	It is a typical self-help organization which materialized as a direct consequence of the unfulfilled needs and yearnings 
	of the Ethiopian Muslim diaspora living in Sweden. The movement was first initiated by a small group of Muslim friends in Stockholm who experienced the emptiness, solitude, and deprivation of living in a foreign land without the warmth and support that could only come from brothers and sisters of one’s own faith. The call that rallied us all was first sounded by these few Muslim brothers in Stockholm. This later resounded throughout Sweden thus leading eventually to the establishment of Negashi</p>
	<p><h3>The Society’s aims shall be:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>To present and enhance the understanding of Islam as a complete way of life to Muslims and non-Muslims alike through stimulating debate and discussion</li>
		<li>To create a tolerant and open-minded environment in which Islamic services and advice can be offered to the Society’s members.</li>
		<li>To foster a sense of community through the organisation of social and other activities and with the intention of developing a balanced Islamic identity</li>
		<li>To provide support and welfare for members of the Society.</li>
		<li>To provide support and welfare for the all Muslims living in Ethiopia.</li>
		<li>To implement all of the above according to the Qur’an, Sunnah and Islamic Jurisprudence.</li>
	</ul>
